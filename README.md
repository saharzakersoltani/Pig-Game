## Game Description

The Pig Game is a turn-based dice game for two players. The goal is to be the first player to reach **50 points**. On each turn, a player can:

- Roll the dice as many times as they like.
- Each roll adds the dice number to their **current score**.
- But if they roll a **1**, they lose their current score and it becomes the next player's turn.
- At any time, the player can **"Hold"** to save their current score to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.

The first player to reach **50 points** wins the game! 

## How to Play

1. Click **"Roll Dice"** to roll the dice.
2. If the dice roll is **not 1**, the number adds to your **current score**.
3. If the dice roll is **1**, your turn ends and your current score is reset to 0.
4. Click **"Hold"** to add the current score to your **total score** and pass the turn.
5. First to **50 points** wins!
